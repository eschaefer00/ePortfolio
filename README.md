This repository is created for my ePortfolio in Software Engineering.

You can find the ePortfolio's code and some snippets for explanation in the folder 'src'. 
The used dataset can be found in 'data'.
My results from the trained NeuralProphet models are in 'results'.

Furthermore you can find my presentation on the first level of the repo.
